# SurveyForm_ResponseWebDesign-CertificationProject-FreeCodeCamp

PortfolioWebpage is a certification from a course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), which it's called "Response Web Design" (which you can check [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)).

The main goal of this project it's to put into use the different skills that we have learned until that point in time, creating a web similar to [this one]([https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks)).
In my case I decided that I wanted to give an upgrade to the page, so it can be more responsive, and better for navigation in general.
